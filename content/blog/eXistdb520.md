# v5.2.0 - January 23rd, 2020

We are very happy to announce that eXist-db 5.2.0 has been released.

5.2.0 is a minor release, and as such should be 100% API compatible
with 5.0.0. Whilst this is a fairly conservative release, it fixes two
critical issues:

1. We fixed a concurrency issue in the reuse of hot Locks which could
appear under high-load and cause a transaction to error and abort.
This issue is present in all eXist-db 5.x.x versions prior to 5.2.0,
but not 4.7.1. This issue could cause corruption in a <5.2.0 system.

2. We fixed a live-lock in the Transaction Manager which
could appear under high-load and prevent a transaction from completing.
This issue is present in all eXist-db 5.x.x version prior to 5.2.0,
but not 4.7.1. This issue could cause a <5.2.0 system to eventually lock-up.
