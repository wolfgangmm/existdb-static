# v5.0.0 - September 2nd, 2019

We are very happy to announce that eXist-db 5.0.0 has been released.

eXist-db 5 represents a substantial development effort, incorporating more than 1,400 commits from 26 contributors over the course of two and a half years.

The most significant improvements to this version of eXist-db involve collection and document locking. The focus of this effort firstly was to ensure "correctness" (i.e., to prevent database corruption) and secondly to improve concurrent performance (i.e., performance when many users are accessing the database) and reporting on the state of the system to aid developers and system administrators in diagnosing locking issues. These and other improvements detailed below aim to dramatically boost eXist-db's reliability and stability.

Other highlights of this release include that eXist-db has a new faceted browsing facility, supports more standard XQuery 3.1 functions, and is now built using Maven and is available via DockerHub. Read more about these and all of the improvements below. Be sure to read to the end for important notes about upgrading. 

## Features

* New Dashboard and Package Manager [#2438](https://github.com/eXist-db/exist/pull/2438).
* Improved the performance of the Lock Table [#2591](https://github.com/eXist-db/exist/pull/2591).
* Improved the performance of Lock Striping [#2831](https://github.com/eXist-db/exist/pull/2831).
* Optimized XMLString to reduce copying.
* Spatial Index is now available again [#2601](https://github.com/eXist-db/exist/pull/2601).
* Options can now be passed to `ft:search` queries.
* A leading wildcard can now be used in `ft:search` queries [#2468](https://github.com/eXist-db/exist/pull/2468).
* Added the new function `ft:index-keys-for-field` for the Lucene Index to complement `util:index-keys` for field indexes.
* Added support for faceting with the Lucene Index [#2629](https://github.com/eXist-db/exist/pull/2629). See the documentation for how to [attach fields or facets](http://exist-db.org/exist/apps/doc/lucene#facets-and-fields) to an indexed node, using XQuery expressions to select/construct content. Query across fields, use them for sorting or drill down into a query result using facets.
* Added XQuery 3.1 `fn:contains-token` [#2799](https://github.com/eXist-db/exist/pull/2799), `fn:parse-ietf-date`  [#2866](https://github.com/eXist-db/exist/pull/2866), and  `fn:random-number-generator` functions.
* Added the `system:get-product-name` function.
* Added the `xmldb:copy-resource` and `xmldb:copy-collection` functions.
* Rewrote the Service Manager for Windows platforms.
* Docker images now use an Uber jar for easy deployment.
* New Jar Installer based on IzPack 5.

## Removed

We have removed the Java Web Application Archive (WAR) build of eXist-db. We no longer support running eXist-db inside a 3rd-party Servlet container such as Apache Tomcat. If you wish to operate eXist-db as a Server, you should instead run the server using the provided Jetty start-up scripts.

We have also removed a number of previously deprecated functions, modules, and extensions:

## New Build System
The build system for eXist-db was previously Apache [Ant](https://ant.apache.org/). With 5.x.x we have completed a full migration of the build system to Apache [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/). Maven affords us a much more modular, rigorous, and flexible process, whilst reducing the maintenance burden that we experienced with Ant. We are now also able to easily publish [artifacts to Maven Central](https://search.maven.org/search?q=g:org.exist-db) for those eXist-db users that embed eXist-db within their own applications.

One major change, is that eXist-db can no longer be built "in-place" from a Git clone, instead building eXist-db now generates a distribution. It is recommended that all users working with the source code, should start with a fresh clone of eXist-db 5.0.0, as its source footprint is not compatible with 5.0.0-RC7 or older.

The *Building eXist-db* documentation page has been updated with the latest instructions for building eXist-db with Maven.



## Backwards Compatibility

eXist-db 5.0.0 is binary compatible with eXist-db RC8, RC7, and RC6. Regardless, before upgrading to this version of eXist-db, it is strongly recommended to perform a full backup and restore. Users who are upgrading should always consult the [Upgrading Guide](https://exist-db.org/exist/apps/doc/upgrading.xml) in the documentation. For details of backwards compatibility with versions of eXist-db prior to 5.0.0-RC6, please see the Backwards Compatibility details of [5.0.0-RC6](http://www.exist-db.org/exist/apps/wiki/blogs/eXist/eXistdb500RC6).

**NOTE**: Applications that shipped with previous version of eXist-db are not guaranteed to be forwards compatible. To ensure smooth operation you should clear your web browser's cache before trying to access newer apps.

## Downloading this Version
* eXist-db v5.0.0 is available for download from [GitHub](https://github.com/eXist-db/exist/releases/tag/eXist-5.0.0).
* Docker images for are available from eXist-db's [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/existdb/existdb/tags/).
* Maven artifacts are available from [Maven Central](https://search.maven.org/search?q=g:org.exist-db).
* Mac users of the [Homebrew](http://brew.sh) package repository may acquire eXist 5.0.0 directly from there via. the `exist-db` cask.

## High Scores!
We would like to say a big *Thank You* to all of those developers who contributed to eXist-db 5.0.0. Your contributions were very welcome.
