## v5.0.0-RC4 - September 21, 2018

The fourth Release Candidate (RC) for eXist-db 5.0.0 has been released.

eXist-db 5.0.0-RC4 builds atop eXist-db [5.0.0-RC3](http://www.exist-db.org/exist/apps/wiki/blogs/eXist/eXistdb500RC3) with a just one new feature, and several small but important bug fixes.

* Numerous fixes for addressing nodes which are direct children of the Document Node.

* Fixed a problem where XQuery modules could only be loaded from `xmldb:` style URIs.

  * Fixed problems with `null` handling.
  * Resolved several NullPointerException cases.
  * Fixed an issue with empty parameter handling.

* Removed unnecessary buffering with ByteArrayInputStream.

* XML:DB Remote API `#getContentAsDOM()` now returns the correct node type, not just elements.
