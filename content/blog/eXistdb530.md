# eXist-db 5.3.0 Release Notes

It’s been quite a while since the last release. A lot has been happening behind the scenes, and we are happy to share the outcome with you.

This release is binary compatible with eXist-db 5.2.0.

## Breaking changes

- Before upgrading an eXist 5.2.0 or earlier system to eXist 5.3.0 (or as soon as possible after upgrading), be sure to upgrade **existdb-packageservice** to the latest release, version 1.3.13 or higher. Since Dashboard relies on this library for all package-related operations, this upgrade must be performed outside Dashboard. To upgrade this package outside of Dashboard, either submit the following query to eXist via eXide or the Java Admin Client as an admin user:

```xquery
xquery version "3.1";

repo:remove("http://exist-db.org/apps/existdb-packageservice"),
repo:install-and-deploy("http://exist-db.org/apps/existdb-packageservice", 
    "http://exist-db.org/exist/apps/public-repo/find")
```

- The **shared resources** and **markdown** packages are no longer bundled with eXist-db. If your application depends on those you can still declare dependencies on them in your package metadata and download them from the [package repository](https://exist-db.org/exist/apps/public-repo/index.html).
- **eXide**’s app generator function has been removed from eXide v3.0.0, as part of important improvements to the application. For generating apps, please use the much better yeoman-based [generator-exist](https://github.com/eXist-db/generator-exist) tool.
- **Dashboard** v2.0.8 has [a known issue](https://github.com/eXist-db/dashboard/issues/194) that can cause requests a 404 error to appear after logging in to the administrative section. Until a permanent fix has been discovered, you can clear the affected browser of this problem by logging out and back in via eXide or Monex.
- The default eXist-db configuration settings are **not production ready**. Make sure to consult our [article on best practices ](https://exist-db.org/exist/apps/doc/production_good_practice.xml) before making your eXist-db instance publicly available. The new [existdb-config](https://github.com/eXistSolutions/existdb-config) project implements these "best practices" and can easily be used to harden your eXist-db(s) from version 5.1.1 till 5.3.0. 

## Highlights

### XQuery 3.1 compatibility

- Improved handling of the XQuery type system - [#3363](https://github.com/exist-db/exist/pull/3363), [#3266](https://github.com/exist-db/exist/pull/3266), [#3728](https://github.com/exist-db/exist/pull/3728), [#3791](https://github.com/exist-db/exist/pull/3791)
- Function types are now allowed as values in context item expressions
- Duplicate functions will reliably throw a useful error
- Root context is shielded from user defined functions
- Several fixes for positional predicates 
- When errors are thrown in XQuery most of them will now have useful location information
- Fixed parser issues to allow empty function body, and allow `||` in attribute and element content
- Allow other seed types in fn:random-number-generator (like dates) - [#3072](https://github.com/eXist-db/exist/pull/3072)
- Fixed the cardinality of fn:random-number-generator#1 - [#3249](https://github.com/eXist-db/exist/pull/3249)
- Improved `fn:format-number` - [#3348](https://github.com/eXist-db/exist/pull/3348)
- Made `fn:collection` spec compliant - [#3349](https://github.com/eXist-db/exist/pull/3349)
- Allow sequences for batch deletions in `map:remove` and `array:remove` - [#3328](https://github.com/eXist-db/exist/pull/3228), [#3692](https://github.com/eXist-db/exist/pull/3692)

### New functions added

- `array:sort` - [#3596](https://github.com/eXist-db/exist/pull/3596)
- `fn:document-uri#0` - [#3644](https://github.com/eXist-db/exist/pull/3644)
- `fn:trace#1` - [#3597](https://github.com/eXist-db/exist/pull/3597)
- `fn:xml-to-json` - [#3141](https://github.com/eXist-db/exist/pull/3141)

### Other enhancements

- Module handling and caching was improved significantly
- Both `controller.xq` and `controller.xql` are now recognized in apps that use eXist's URL Rewriting facility, to conform with the community convention of `.xq` for main modules and `.xqm` for library modules.
- The implementation of maps was changed to gain performance
- Allow Bearer tokens and other schemes than "Basic" in Authentication header
- Allow HTTP verb PATCH
- Custom base64 handling code was replaced with apache.commons code and a new function `util:base64-encode-url-safe` was added
- Enhanced `util:eval` to preserve the original error information
- In Lucene, you can now use different analyzers for indexing and querying

### Bundled apps

- All bundled applications have their frontend dependencies updated.
- The index view in **monex** now lists new fields and facets - [#124](https://github.com/eXist-db/monex/pull/124).
- See the next section which lists several issues affecting apps included in the eXist 5.3.0 distribution.

### Licensing

A lot of effort was poured into getting eXist-db’s source code licensed properly. It is now consistently LGPL 2.1, with exceptions where code from other projects is used with their permission.
