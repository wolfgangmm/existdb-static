**Full Changelog**: [https://github.com/eXist-db/exist/compare/eXist-6.0.1...eXist-6.1.0](https://github.com/eXist-db/exist/compare/eXist-6.0.1...eXist-6.1.0)

## Backwards Compatibility

eXist-db 6.1.0 is backwards binary compatible with previous 6.x.x versions, which should make upgrading simple with no changes required to XQuery or XSLT application code. For those users migrating from 4.x.x or 5.x.x versions to 6.x.x a full backup and restore of the database will be required and possibly some small changes to XQuery and XSLT application code. Please review previous releases' notes for detailed information.
