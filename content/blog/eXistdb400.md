    * Now implements an LRU policy with both TTL and size options.

* Scheduled task option `unschedule-on-exception` is now exposed in `conf.xml`.
* Each thread that eXist creates is now explicitly named for easier identification.

    * YAJSW 12.11

## Performance Improvements
* Cache Extension Module rewritten to use Caffeine.

### Bug Fixes
* Corrected concurrent access to Document Metadata, previously incorrect due to lazy-loading and incorrect locking.
* DocumentSets now always unlock all locks that they acquired.
* Fixed a number of issues with `xs:base64Binary` and `xs:hexBinary` returned from XQuery execution in various API's.
* Fixed a regression with XQuery Update insert into an empty element.
* Fixed a bug in the EXPath HTTP Client with connection pooling.
* Fixed a bad thread synchronization in JMX.
* Corrected invalid type `empty()` to `empty-sequence()`.
* Fixed overzealous locking in XML:DB Local API copy operations.
* Fix to Namespace handling on in-memory DOM nodes.
* Fixed a `NullPointerException` in `fn:id`.
* Fixed comparison issue with empty sequences.
* Fixed broker leak in Image Extension Module.
* Math Extension Module functions now correctly report their namespace prefix.
* Improved function signatures types:
	* `map` to `map(*)`
	* `array` to `array(*)`
	* `function` to `function(*)`
* Fixed the XQuery Error Codes of several atomic value comparison operators.
* Improved warning and error messages during EXPath Package deployment.
* Many file path related fixes for building and running on Microsoft Windows platforms.
* Removed last Java Endorsed Library paths to support Java 9.
* Updated the Java AppBundler (which is used for staring eXist), to provide better Java 9 support.
* Build labels are now correctly calculated when building from an installed (not-git) product.
* IntelliJ IDEA project files now support correct ApectJ tools.

### Apps
The bundled applications of the Documentation, eXide, and Monex have all been updated to the latest versions. A new UserManager application is also shipped, which replaces the previous in-built UserManager of the Dashboard.

### API Changes
* Legacy XQuery draft syntax `empty()` has been removed. You should now use the spec. compliant syntax `empty-sequence()`.
* The previously `numeric` type was renamed to `xs:numeric`. `numeric` is now marked as legacy.
* The legacy Atom module (`org.exist.atom`) has been removed.
* Sending an invalid XQuery to the RESTServer now correctly returns HTTP 400 Bad Request, instead of HTTP 202 Accepted.
* XMLDB API interfaces have been renamed to be more consistent (e.g. `EXistXQueryService`)
* Locks are now re-acquired by a Transaction rather than ownership transferred.

### Backwards Compatibility

* eXist-db v4.0.0 is backwards binary-compatible as far as v3.0, but not with earlier versions. Users who are upgrading should always consult the [Upgrading Guide](http://exist-db.org/exist/apps/doc/upgrading.xml) in the documentation.

* **NOTE**: The version of Dashboard that was installed with eXist-db 3.6.1 (or earlier) is incompatible with eXist-db 4.0.0. If you plan to migrate your entire database to eXist-db 4.0.0, you **MUST** take one of the following steps to allow Dashboard to work after the upgrade:

    1. If you have not yet installed eXist-db 4.0.0, open `Dashboard > Package Manager`, and upgrade Dashboard to `0.4.10`, or run this script in eXide or the Java Admin Client: `repo:install-and-deploy("http://exist-db.org/apps/dashboard", "http://demo.exist-db.org/exist/apps/public-repo/modules/find.xql")`. Then you may safely install eXist-db 4.0.0 and use Dashboard.
    
    2. If you install eXist-db 4.0.0 before upgrading Dashboard, run this script in eXide or the Java Admin Client: `repo:install-and-deploy("http://exist-db.org/apps/dashboard", "http://demo.exist-db.org/exist/apps/public-repo/modules/find.xql")`. Then you may use Dashboard.

### Downloading This Version
* eXist-db v4.0.0 is available for download from [GitHub](https://github.com/eXist-db/exist/releases/tag/eXist-4.0.0).
