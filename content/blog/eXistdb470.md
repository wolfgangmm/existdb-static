# v4.7.0 - May 19, 2019

This release closes a major memory leak introduced in 4.6.0, removes a deadlock condition and fixes a number of bugs.

## Features

* Update to Tika version 1.20 for content extraction module and fix some related bugs
* Add in-memory buffer to solve performance issue accessing remote eXist via XML:DB API
* Update EXQuery RESTXQ to 0.1.34, fixes parsing issues with Accept and Content-Type HTTP headers

## Bug Fixes

* XML serializer leaking memory
* Fix deadlock: memory size from the collection does not need a READ_LOCK, it is an estimate anyway
* Test suite was not correctly reporting failing tests
* Fix ByteArrayPool and CharArrayPool memory leaks
* Fix problems with computed namespace construction
* When loading XQuery modules dynamically, declared global variables were not analyzed properly
* Switch out org.exist.util.hashtable implementation for FastUtil. eXist's implementations have problems with hash-collisions and chaining
* Allow for passing options for ft:search queries. This allows to perform leading-wildcard queries on computed index fields
* Fix arrow operator and higher order functions: context sequence passed incorrectly
* Fix broken XQuery Update for 'insert following'
* Fix ArrayOutOfBoundsException querying doc with enclosed expression and fn:id function
* Fix EXPath HTTP Client - Previously when override-media-type was set and a charset was specified, the charset was ignored
* Fix an issue introduced by PR #2367: a lucene index configured with a match attribute should only be created for nodes matching the path, not all descendant nodes
