**Full Changelog**: [compare the changes from eXist-6.3.0 to eXist-6.4.0](https://github.com/eXist-db/exist/compare/eXist-6.3.0...eXist-6.4.0)

## Backwards Compatibility

eXist-db 6.4.0 is backwards binary compatible with all previous 6.x.x releases. This should make upgrading simple with no changes required to XQuery or XSLT application code.
For those users migrating from 4.x.x or 5.x.x versions to 6.x.x a full backup and restore of the database will be required and possibly some small changes to XQuery and XSLT application code. Please review previous releases' notes for detailed information.

**NOTE:** `system:get-module-load-path#0` will now always return the load path of the _current_ context. 
If you need to get the module load path of the root context then you need to call `system:get-main-module-load-path#0` instead.
