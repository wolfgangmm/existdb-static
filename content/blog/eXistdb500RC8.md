title: eXist-db 5.0.0 RC8
updated: '2019-09-02T21:10:02.175000+02:00'

# v5.0.0-RC8 - July 31, 2019

The eighth Release Candidate (RC) for eXist-db 5.0.0 has been released.

eXist-db 5.0.0-RC8 builds atop eXist-db 5.0.0-RC7 with several new features and important bug fixes.

NOTE: This is likely the last Release Candidate before 5.0.0 is released. We kindly ask all users to test their applications on RC8, and report back any new issues since RC7. The testing window for RC8 is between 2 and 4 weeks, dependant on any issues reported by users. All being well, 5.0.0 final will be released by 31st Aug 2019.

## Removed

We have removed the Java Web Application Archive (WAR) build of eXist-db. We no longer support running eXist-db inside a 3rd-party Servlet container such as Apache Tomcat. If you wish to operate eXist-db as a Server, you should instead run it server using the provided Jetty start-up scripts.

We have also removed a number of previously deprecated functions, modules, and extensions:

[Craig Berry has kindly provided](https://github.com/eXist-db/exist/issues/2626#issuecomment-484991704) a [Perl script](https://github.com/eXist-db/exist/files/3099085/audit_removals.pl.zip) which you can run against your XQuery code to audit for most of these changes.


## New Build System
The build system for eXist-db was previously Apache [Ant](https://ant.apache.org/). With RC8 we have completed a complete migration of the build system to Apache [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/). Maven affords us a much more modular and rigorous, and flexible process, whilst reducing the maintenance burden that we experienced with Ant. We are now also able to easily publish [artifacts to Maven Central](https://search.maven.org/search?q=g:org.exist-db) for those eXist-db users that embed eXist-db within their own applications.

One major change, is that eXist-db can no longer be built "in-place" from a Git clone, instead building eXist-db now generates a distribution. It is recommended that all users working with the source code, should start with a fresh clone of eXist-db RC8, as its source footprint is not compatible with RC7 and before.

The *Building eXist-db* documentation page has been updated with the latest instructions for building eXist-db with Maven.



### Backwards Compatibility

eXist-db 5.0.0-RC8 is binary compatible with eXist-db RC6 and RC7. Regardless, before upgrading to this version of eXist-db, it is strongly recommended to perform a full backup and restore. Users who are upgrading should always consult the [Upgrading Guide](https://exist-db.org/exist/apps/doc/upgrading.xml) in the documentation. For details of backwards compatibility with versions of eXist-db prior to 5.0.0-RC6, please see the Backwards Compatibility details of [5.0.0-RC6](http://www.exist-db.org/exist/apps/wiki/blogs/eXist/eXistdb500RC6).

**NOTE**: EXPath Apps shipped with previous version of eXist-db, are not guaranteed to be forwards compatible with RC8. As such when restoring a backup to RC8 you should at least exclude the following from your `/db/apps` folder:
1. `/db/apps/dashboard`
2. `/db/apps/doc`
3. `/db/apps/eXide`
4. `/db/apps/fundocs`
5. `/db/apps/markdown`
6. `/db/apps/monex`
7. `/db/apps/packageservice`
8. `/db/apps/shared-resources`

If in doubt, you should consider excluding `/db/apps` entrirely from your backup archive during the restore, and then subsequently installing the latest versions of the Apps you need via the Dashboard's Package Manager.

You can selectively restore single collections by unzipping the backup and pointing the restore to a single  `__contents__.xml` file. This will only restore the corresponding collection.

An alternative approach would be:

1. restore the entire backup, taking into account that the dashboard won’t be available afterwards
2. open the Java admin client and issue an XQuery to update shared-resources and dashboard:

```
repo:remove("http://exist-db.org/apps/shared"),
repo:remove("http://exist-db.org/apps/dashboard"),
repo:install-and-deploy("http://exist-db.org/apps/shared", "http://exist-db.org/exist/apps/public-repo/find"),
repo:install-and-deploy("http://exist-db.org/apps/dashboard", "http://exist-db.org/exist/apps/public-repo/find“)
```
