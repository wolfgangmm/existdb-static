### Backwards Compatibility

eXist-db 5.0.0-RC5 is not binary compatible with previous versions of eXist-db (including earlier 5.0.0 Release Candidates) because of new BLOB Store, which required changes to the collections.dbx and Journal. Before upgrading to this version of eXist-db, you **MUST** perform a full backup and restore. Users who are upgrading should always consult the [Upgrading Guide](https://exist-db.org/exist/apps/doc/upgrading.xml) in the documentation. For details of backwards compatibility with versions of eXist-db prior to 5.0.0-RC1 please see the [*Backwards Compatibility* details of 5.0.0-RC1](http://www.exist-db.org/exist/apps/wiki/blogs/eXist/eXistdb500RC1).
