### Backwards Compatibility

* eXist-db v4.5.0 is not binary compatible with previous versions of eXist-db because of improvements to the on-disk journal format. Before upgrading to this version of eXist-db, you **MUST** perform a full backup and restore. Users who are upgrading should always consult the [Upgrading Guide](https://exist-db.org/exist/apps/doc/upgrading.xml) in the documentation.

* **NOTE**: The version of Dashboard that was installed with eXist-db 3.6.1 (or earlier) is incompatible with eXist-db 4.0.0 and newer. If you plan to migrate your entire database to eXist-db 4.4.0, you **MUST** take one of the following steps to allow Dashboard to work after the upgrade:

    1. If you have not yet installed eXist-db 4.5.0, open `Dashboard > Package Manager`, and upgrade Dashboard to `0.4.10`, or run this script in eXide or the Java Admin Client: `repo:install-and-deploy("http://exist-db.org/apps dashboard", "http://demo.exist-db.org/exist/apps/public-repo/modules/find.xql")`. Then you may safely install eXist-db 4.5.0 and use Dashboard.

	2. If you install eXist-db 4.5.0 before upgrading Dashboard, run this script in eXide or the Java Admin Client: `repo:install-and-deploy("http://exist-db.org/apps/dashboard", "http://demo.exist-db.org/exist/apps/public-repo/modules/find.xql")`. Then you may use Dashboard.
