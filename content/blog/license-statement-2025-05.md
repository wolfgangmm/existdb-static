We recently discovered license changes for code that Evolved Binary derived from eXist-db in Elemental, its fork of eXist-db. The changes were published on GitHub. Furthermore the Elemental website states that it is distributed under a different license than LGPL 2.1.

This constitutes a clear violation of the LGPL license. We consulted with one of Europeâ€™s most renowned experts on Open Source Software licenses: [Dr. Till Jaeger](https://jbb.de/anwaelte/dr-till-jaeger/) confirmed that LGPL-2.1 does not permit relicensing, except to GPL, according to Sec. 3 of the LGPL-2.1. Any other relicensing under different license terms without the consent of all copyright owners of the respective code constitutes copyright infringement.

eXist-db will and must stay under LGPL 2.1. We stand by open source software and our license. We have neither consented nor been approached about relicensing our contributions.

We therefore ask Evolved Binary to remedy the license violation immediately.
